# Animated 3D Image Grid with Lightbox

This is an adaptation of two separate functions.
The animated grid was adapted from CoDrops (http://www.codrops.com)
The lightbox function comes from Lokesh Dhakar (http://www.lokeshdhakar.com)

My thanks to both. See individual files for specifics.

#Main Structure

The index.html page loads loads the HTML grid with the smaller, cropped images.  Clicking on the image pops up the full image.
Most everything is handled by three .js files:

jquery.gridrotator.js controls all of the animation.
lightbox-plus-jquery.min.js handles the pop-up images.
modernizr.custom.26633.js handles browser compatability.

style.css has all the formatting for the grid placement and lightbox styles, as well as some responsive commands.
